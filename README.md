## NYC Motor Vehicle Collision

The goal of this project was exploratory data analysis of the NYC Motor Vehicle Collision dataset, made publicaly available by [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95).

As a New Yorker, I walk to school and work and so have wondered about the safety of the streets I must go through. We hear about drivers plowing into pedestrians. In May 2017 this happened at Times Square, and it resulted in the death of a young girl. Since then I have constant fear in my mind that what if someone rams car into the walkway? So with this fear on my mind, I decided to visualize the NYC Motor Vehicle Collision dataset to determine some significant insights.
